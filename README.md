# PoCaPNet: A Novel Approach for Surgical Phase Recognition Using Speech and X-Ray Images

PoCaPNet is a multimodal network based on two-stage TCN architecture and designed for surgical phase recognition using speech and X-Ray data collected during port-catheter placement surgeries. 

## Getting Started

To install dependencies, we recommend creating a virtual environment as following:
```
    - python3 -m venv pocapenv
    - source pocapenv/bin/activate
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Later, you can run following scripts to prepare your data for the training:

    - python preprocessing.py
    - python extract_features.py

This will create ```data``` and ```features``` folders containing audio and image data and features respectively. We recommend choosing a large storage via ```utils/paths.py``` for these folders as they can grow very large very quickly. If a large storage is not available, you can manipulate ```data.py``` script, which is responsible for reading data for training epochs, to generate features on the fly instead of reading from the disk.  

```utils/hparams.py``` holds all settings for the training as well as the preprocessing and feature extraction. You can adjust preferred values in this script for these steps.  

## Prerequisites

The main medical dataset, PoCap Corpus [1], is unfortunately is not publicly available in order to ensure data security of patients and medical personal.

## Training

```main.py``` file encapsulates training and testing modules. You can simply run this script and start the experiment:

    - python main.py
